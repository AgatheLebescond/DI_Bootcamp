suggestions for improvement:
- The first exercise (Person class) is not related to the chapter content (Cats, Dogs, Songs, Zoo).  Remove it.
- In Exercise 1 (Cats), the first version of `find_oldest_cat` is more efficient than the second.  The second version iterates unnecessarily.
- Exercise 4 (Zoo) is missing the `get_groups()` method, which is a key part of the instructions. Add this method to print the grouped animals.  The `sort_animals` method is correctly implemented but could be simplified.
- Add docstrings to all functions for better readability and understanding.
